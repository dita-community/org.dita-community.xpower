DITA OT extensions to PDF transformations

This package offers a very powerful extension to the official DITA-OT.
It solves many open points in the official distribution.

The package delivers an entire DITA-OT installation based always on the
latest available release. Some minor changes had to be done in the
org.dita.pdf2 directory to fix a few DITA-OT bugs, all other extensions are 
implemented in the org.dita-community.xpower plugin, not in the org.dita.pdf2.

That's why this package does not simply come as one "plugin" directory.

The package covers a test installation of the full Acrobat ezRead plugin
which allows necessary PDF post processing of DITA files to get out
proper PDF files that the formatters XEP / AHF cannot produce.

All extensions are explained in the Xpower User Manual also found in the
package. (BOOKS/REFERENCES) directory

Due to its many new features and extensions the work has about doubled 
the size of the DITA-OT but it does still follow strictly the idea 
of the DITA-OT and will in the future.

To achieve xtreme editorial performance the xpower package quite rich,
therefore the installation has been made "1-button"-easy.

WHAT YOU NEED:
    The executable tools are only available for Windows.
    If someone wants to bring them to Linux, I would cooperate with
    the source code.
    
    The documentation explains oxygen editor and AHF Formatter, however
    the package does not require any of these for its tools.
    
    (except that the oxygen annotations like comments/track changes
     are processed into PDF ... a feature that is only available with
     oxygen processing-instructions).
     
TO UNDERSTAND:
    Read the BOOKS\REF_xpwr_XpowerUserGuide.pdf
    
TO INSTALL:
    Launch 01_ExtractE.bat
    
TO ASK:
    Contact helmut.scherzer@gi-de.com
    
TO BUY:
    There is nothing to buy, the package is offered for free.
    
    Currently the ezRead Plugin is available as test version
    which corresponds to a "professional" version that I plan
    to sell somehow from 2016.
    
    When the "professional" version will be available
    for purchase, I will deliver a free "light" version with this 
    package which will allow to do everything required to process
    the actions required to get high professional DITA output.
    For the promised performance output of this package you will not depend
    on a commercial product.
    
The package is open source, but the copyright for the free documentation
and the ezRead plugin stay with Helmut Scherzer.

If you want to dive into the magic of Dita-OT extension, you might
consider purchasing "Dita for Print" from Leigh W. White.

Her book gave me a perfect start and even if I meanwhile have gone to
another dimension of DITA-OT programming ... without that great book
I don't think I'd ever been able to create this package.

In many positions of my extension you will find refererences to her book
that indicate the chapters from which you can learn about the associated
magic. I also commented my extensions (HSX) to make them more understandable.

Have a successful and highly professional output with features that no
documentation has ever seen before. (Promised !)
